ubxsetrates.py

This example illustrates how to send UBX commands to a receiver
(in this case a series of CFG-MSG commands) while simultaneously
reading acknowledgements from the receiver.

Usage:

python3 ubxsetrates.py port="/dev/ttyACM0" baudrate=38400 timout=0.1 rate=4

It implements two threads which run concurrently:
1) an I/O thread which continuously reads UBX data from the
receiver and sends any queued outbound command or poll messages.
2) a process thread which processes parsed UBX data - in this example
it simply prints the parsed data to the terminal.
UBX data is passed between threads using queues.

NB: the rate value means 'per navigation solution' e.g. a rate of
4 means 'every 4th navigation solution', which at a standard solution
interval of 1000ms corresponds to every 4 seconds.

The process thread reads and parses any responses and outputs
them to the terminal. You should also start seeing any incoming
UBX-NAV messages arriving at the designated rate.

The response may be an ACK-ACK acknowledgement message, or an
ACK-NAK message signifying that this particular navigation message
type is not supported by the receiver.
