ubxpoller.py

This example illustrates how to read, write and display UBX messages
"concurrently" using threads and queues. This represents a useful
generic pattern for many end user applications.

Usage:

python3 ubxpoller.py port="/dev/ttyACM0" baudrate=38400 timeout=0.1

It implements two threads which run concurrently:
1) an I/O thread which continuously reads UBX data from the
receiver and sends any queued outbound command or poll messages.
2) a process thread which processes parsed UBX data - in this example
it simply prints the parsed data to the terminal.
UBX data is passed between threads using queues.

Press CTRL-C to terminate.

FYI: Since Python implements a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL),
threads are not strictly concurrent, though this is of minor
practical consequence here.
